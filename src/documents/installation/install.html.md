## With Bower (for browser use)
robocop.js should have installed to `path/to/bower_components/robocop.js/`. You can reference the files in the `dist/` folder, which contains development and minified versions of robocop.js.

```html
<script src="/path/to/bower_components/robocop.js/dist/robocop.min.js"></script>
```

## With NPM (for use with Node)
robocop.js should have installed to `node_modules/robocop.js/`. You can `require` robocop.js just like you would any other npm module.

```html
var robocop = require('robocop.js');
```

## Install Manually
Include the version of robocop.js you downloaded on your web page.

```html
<script src="/js/libs/robocop-0.6.0.min.js"></script>
```
